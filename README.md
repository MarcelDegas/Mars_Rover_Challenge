# Mars_Rover_Challenge
Each rover takes two lines of input
  1. It's position (written as a combination of 2 numbers(X,Y coordinates)) and one letter (N,S,E,W) with one space between.
  2. Instructions on how to explore the space
  3. The first line of code input should be two numbers which specify the max (aka: top right limit) of the grid.
  An example is: 
  5 5
  1 3 N
